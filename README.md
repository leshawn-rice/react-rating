# Star Rating System
This is a star rating system built with react.

It's from an interview question that asks for this component to be built

## Functionality
If you hover over a star, that star and all stars before it are highlighted in gold.

If you click on a star once, that star and all stars before it will be filled in with gold, all stars after it will be emptied

If you click on a star twice, that star and all stars before it will be reset.
